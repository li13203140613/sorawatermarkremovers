OpenAI's newly released Sora 2 video generation model has caused a global sensation, but it's currently in limited testing phase and requires an invitation code to use. This article will detail how to obtain Sora 2 invitation codes and share the latest available codes.

## What is Sora 2?

Sora 2 is OpenAI's second-generation AI video generation model with significant improvements over the first generation:
