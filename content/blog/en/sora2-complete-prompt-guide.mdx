OpenAI's Sora 2 has revolutionized AI video generation, but the key to unlocking its full potential lies in mastering prompt engineering. Whether you're a content creator, marketer, or AI enthusiast, understanding how to write effective prompts is essential for generating stunning, professional-quality videos.

## What is Sora 2?

Sora 2 is OpenAI's next-generation AI video generation model, representing a significant leap forward from its predecessor. Released in early 2025, Sora 2 can create highly realistic videos up to 60 seconds long with unprecedented quality and coherence.

### Key Capabilities

**Advanced Understanding**: Sora 2 comprehends complex instructions, understanding not just what objects to include, but how they should move, interact, and evolve throughout the scene.

**Physical Accuracy**: The model demonstrates remarkable understanding of real-world physics, including:
- Realistic lighting and shadows
- Natural object interactions
- Accurate motion dynamics
- Proper perspective and depth

**Creative Flexibility**: From photorealistic footage to stylized animations, Sora 2 adapts to various aesthetic requirements, supporting styles ranging from cinematic photography to anime, 3D renders, and abstract art.

**Temporal Coherence**: Unlike earlier models, Sora 2 maintains consistent characters, objects, and environments throughout longer video sequences, eliminating the jarring transitions that plagued earlier AI video generators.

### What Makes Sora 2 Special?

- **Multi-shot capability**: Generate videos with multiple camera angles and scene transitions
- **Character consistency**: Keep characters recognizable across different shots
- **Text rendering**: Display readable text within videos
- **Complex actions**: Handle intricate movement sequences and interactions
- **High resolution**: Produce videos up to 1080p quality

## Why Prompts Matter

Think of prompts as the blueprint for your AI-generated video. Just as a skilled architect needs detailed plans to build a masterpiece, Sora 2 requires well-crafted prompts to produce exceptional results.

### The Prompt-Quality Connection

**Specificity Determines Output**: Vague prompts like "a cat playing" yield generic results, while detailed prompts like "a fluffy orange tabby cat with green eyes playfully batting at a red yarn ball on a wooden floor, soft afternoon sunlight streaming through a nearby window" produce targeted, high-quality videos.

**Language Precision Matters**: Sora 2 interprets every word. The difference between "running" and "sprinting," or "bright" and "radiant" significantly impacts the final output. Each adjective, verb, and descriptor shapes the model's understanding.

### Common Prompt Problems

**Problem 1: Under-specification**
```
Bad: "A person walking"
Result: Generic, forgettable video with unclear context
```

**Problem 2: Over-complication**
```
Bad: "A 25-year-old woman with precisely 5'6" height, wearing a red jacket
(pantone 185C), walking at 3.5 mph through a park on a Tuesday afternoon..."
Result: Confused output, model struggles with excessive technical details
```

**Problem 3: Contradictory Instructions**
```
Bad: "Bright nighttime scene with strong sunlight"
Result: Inconsistent lighting, unrealistic atmosphere
```

The solution? Follow the golden rules.

## Sora 2 Prompt Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Be Specific, Not Verbose

**The Principle**: Provide concrete, meaningful details rather than lengthy descriptions.

**Good Example**:
```
A golden retriever puppy with floppy ears chases soap bubbles in a suburban
backyard, its tail wagging enthusiastically as sunlight creates rainbow
reflections in each bubble.
```

**Why it works**:
- Specific breed (golden retriever puppy)
- Distinctive feature (floppy ears)
- Clear action (chases soap bubbles)
- Defined setting (suburban backyard)
- Telling detail (rainbow reflections)

**Bad Example**:
```
A dog that looks happy and energetic is moving around outside in a space
with grass and possibly some other things, doing activities that dogs
typically enjoy doing when they're outside.
```

**Why it fails**: Vague, repetitive, lacks concrete visual details.

### Rule 2: Structure Your Prompt

**The Principle**: Follow a logical order that mirrors how we naturally observe scenes.

**Recommended Structure**:
1. **Subject**: Who or what is the focus?
2. **Action**: What is happening?
3. **Setting**: Where does it take place?
4. **Style/Mood**: What's the aesthetic and atmosphere?
5. **Camera/Technical**: How should it be filmed?

**Template Example**:
```
[Subject] + [Action] + [Setting] + [Lighting/Atmosphere] + [Style/Camera]

A ballet dancer in white tutu + performs pirouettes + on a moonlit stage
+ with soft blue spotlight creating ethereal shadows + cinematic slow
motion, 35mm film aesthetic
```

### Rule 3: Use Visual Language

**The Principle**: Favor descriptive visual terms over abstract concepts.

**Visual Language (Good)**:
- "golden hour sunlight filtering through leaves"
- "rain streaming down window panes"
- "smoke curling upward from a candle"
- "fabric billowing in the wind"

**Abstract Language (Avoid)**:
- "beautiful atmosphere"
- "nice feeling"
- "good vibes"
- "pleasant mood"

**Comparison**:
```
❌ Bad: "A beautiful, emotional scene in nature"
✅ Good: "Soft morning mist hovering over a calm lake, golden sunrise
       reflecting on still water, with silhouettes of pine trees framing
       the scene"
```

### Rule 4: Specify Camera and Motion

**The Principle**: Direct the cinematography to control visual storytelling.

**Camera Angles**:
- "Wide-angle shot"
- "Close-up on face"
- "Bird's eye view"
- "Low angle looking up"
- "Over-the-shoulder perspective"
- "POV (point of view) shot"

**Camera Movement**:
- "Static camera"
- "Slow pan from left to right"
- "Tracking shot following subject"
- "Smooth dolly-in"
- "Orbital rotation around subject"
- "Crane shot rising upward"

**Example with Camera Direction**:
```
Tracking shot following a cyclist through autumn forest path, camera
maintains medium distance as fallen orange leaves swirl in the cyclist's
wake, shallow depth of field keeping background trees softly blurred.
```

### Rule 5: Control Timing and Pacing

**The Principle**: Guide the tempo and rhythm of your video.

**Timing Keywords**:
- "Slow motion" / "Time-lapse"
- "Quick cuts" / "Smooth transitions"
- "Gradual" / "Sudden"
- "Continuous motion" / "Stop and start"
- "Real-time speed" / "Accelerated"

**Pacing Example**:
```
Time-lapse of a bustling city intersection at dusk, car headlights becoming
light trails, sky gradually darkening from blue to deep purple, street
lights flickering on one by one over 20 seconds of accelerated time.
```

## Practical Prompt Templates

slow tracking shot, film noir aesthetic.
```

**Use cases**: Short films, music videos, dramatic content

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall 1: Keyword Stuffing

**What it is**: Cramming too many details hoping for better results.

**Example of over-stuffing**:
```
❌ "Beautiful amazing stunning gorgeous woman with long flowing hair, blue
eyes, red lips, perfect skin, white teeth, elegant dress, high heels,
jewelry, standing in incredible fantastic wonderful garden with flowers,
trees, grass, sky, clouds, sun, birds..."
```

**Better approach**:
```
✅ "Elegant woman in flowing white dress stands in rose garden at golden
hour, gentle breeze moving her long auburn hair, soft focus on blooming
flowers in background."
```

**Lesson**: Quality over quantity. Choose the most impactful details.

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Physical Constraints

**What it is**: Requesting impossible or physics-defying scenarios without stylistic justification.

**Problematic examples**:
```
❌ "Person running at 200 mph through city"
❌ "Water flowing upward into the sky"
❌ "Object appearing and disappearing randomly"
```

**How to fix**: Either make it realistic OR explicitly specify a fantasy/surreal style.

```
✅ Realistic: "Athlete sprinting at full speed through city marathon"
✅ Surreal: "Surreal dream sequence: water flowing upward defying gravity,
          ethereal particles floating, Magritte-inspired impossible physics"
```

### Pitfall 3: Vague Time References

**What it is**: Using unclear temporal descriptions.

**Vague examples**:
```
❌ "During the day sometime"
❌ "When it's getting dark"
❌ "In the evening-ish"
```

**Specific alternatives**:
```
✅ "Mid-afternoon, sun high in clear blue sky"
✅ "Golden hour just before sunset, long shadows"
✅ "Blue hour twilight, first stars appearing"
✅ "Night, illuminated only by full moon"
```

### Pitfall 4: Neglecting Audio Considerations

**What it is**: Forgetting that video atmosphere includes implied sound.

While Sora 2 doesn't generate audio, describing soundscape elements helps create appropriate visual atmosphere:

**Without audio consideration**:
```
❌ "Crowded concert"
```

**With audio consideration**:
```
✅ "Energetic rock concert, crowd with raised hands, visible sound waves
from speakers, drummer mid-beat, vibrant stage lights pulsing to rhythm,
capturing the intensity of live performance"
```

The visual cues (raised hands, drummer mid-beat, pulsing lights) imply the audio experience.

### Pitfall 5: Inconsistent Style Mixing

**What it is**: Combining contradictory aesthetic styles without intention.

**Inconsistent mixing**:
```
❌ "Photorealistic portrait in anime style with vintage 1920s photograph
aesthetic and 3D rendered background"
```

**Consistent approach**:
```
✅ "Portrait in anime style inspired by Makoto Shinkai, with soft
watercolor backgrounds and detailed character features"
```

OR

```
✅ "Photorealistic portrait with vintage 1920s aesthetic, sepia tones,
grain texture, and period-appropriate styling"
```

**Lesson**: Choose one primary style and support it consistently.

## Quick Start Tips

### Tip 1: Start Simple, Then Iterate

Don't aim for perfection on your first attempt. Begin with a basic prompt, generate, and refine based on results.

**Iteration example**:

**Version 1** (Basic):
```
"Cat sitting on windowsill"
```

**Version 2** (Add detail):
```
"Orange tabby cat sitting on sunny windowsill, looking outside"
```

**Version 3** (Add atmosphere):
```
"Orange tabby cat sitting on wooden windowsill, gazing out at garden,
afternoon sunlight illuminating its fur"
```

**Version 4** (Add style):
```
"Orange tabby cat sitting on rustic wooden windowsill, gazing out at
blooming garden, warm afternoon sunlight creating soft highlights on
its fur, cozy cottagecore aesthetic, shallow depth of field"
```

### Tip 2: Study Reference Examples

Before creating, research similar content:
- Search for videos with your desired aesthetic
- Note specific visual elements that work
- Identify lighting, camera angles, and pacing
- Translate observations into prompt language

### Tip 3: Use the "5W1H" Framework

Answer these questions in your prompt:
- **Who**: What subjects are in the scene?
- **What**: What action is happening?
- **Where**: What's the setting/location?
- **When**: What time of day/season?
- **Why**: What's the mood/purpose? (emotion, storytelling goal)
- **How**: How is it filmed? (camera, movement, style)

### Tip 4: Create a Personal Prompt Library

Maintain a collection of successful prompts:
- Save prompts that generated great results
- Note what worked and why
- Create templates for common needs
- Build style references you can reuse

**Example library entry**:
```
Category: Product Showcase
Prompt: "[Product] rotating on [surface], [key feature visible], studio
        lighting with soft shadows, white background, macro lens,
        360-degree rotation"
Works well for: Small consumer electronics, jewelry, cosmetics
Notes: Adjust rotation speed based on product complexity
```

### Tip 5: Leverage Negative Space

Don't fill every second with action. Strategic pauses and empty space create visual impact:

```
"Lone tree on minimalist hillside, vast empty sky above, gentle sway in
breeze, extended moment of stillness before bird takes flight from branch,
emphasizing scale and solitude"
```

### Tip 6: Test Single Variables

When refining, change one element at a time:
- First test: Adjust lighting description
- Second test: Modify camera movement
- Third test: Change time of day

This helps you understand what each change contributes.

### Tip 7: Use Style References Wisely

Reference established visual styles, but be specific:

**Vague style reference**:
```
❌ "Make it look cinematic"
```

**Specific style reference**:
```
✅ "Cinematic style inspired by Blade Runner 2049: high contrast, orange
   and blue color grading, atmospheric fog, wide anamorphic aspect ratio"
```

### Tip 8: Consider the Full Video Arc

For longer videos, describe beginning, middle, and end:

```
"Opening on close-up of coffee beans, slow pull-back revealing barista
grinding beans, steam rising, mid-shot of espresso machine in action,
final shot of perfectly crafted latte art, smooth transitions between
scenes, warm earthy tones throughout"
```

### Tip 9: Balance Control and Creativity

Provide enough direction without over-constraining:
- **Too loose**: "Something cool with technology"
- **Too tight**: "Exactly 3.7 seconds of a robot arm moving 45 degrees..."
- **Just right**: "Robotic arm performing precise assembly movements,
                   industrial setting, clean lighting showing mechanical
                   detail"

### Tip 10: Learn from the Community

- Join Sora user communities and forums
- Analyze trending Sora 2 videos
- Share prompts and learn from others
- Participate in prompt challenges
